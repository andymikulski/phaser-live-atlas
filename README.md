# LiveAtlas
## In-browser texture atlas generator for Phaser 3

Features:
 - Add/remove atlas frames on the fly
 - "Pixel art mode" available for a crisp texture appearance
 - Factories for creating new Phaser objects that are tied into the atlas
   - All factories return native Phaser `GameObject`s (i.e. `Image` or `Sprite`)
   - `atlas.make.image()` creates a `Image` with the correct atlas reference
   - `atlas.make.sprite()` creates a `Sprite`
 - Image transparency trimming
    - Including spritesheet frames!
 - Spritesheet support
    - Import other spritesheets into your atlas
    - Each sprite frame is trimmed and packed just like any other image, saving space
  - Animation support
    - An `atlas.anims.play(...)` function is available to facilitate working with animations
      - `play` is async, so you can easily `await` animations to complete on a given sprite
    - Animation data is stored on the scene itself to save memory
      - This also means any animation can be played on any `Sprite`
    - Sprites and one-off animations are easily created via `make.sprite` and `make.animation`
 - Serialization support
    - localStorage + sessionStorage support for smaller atlases (< 5mb)
    - IndexedDB support for atlases larger than
 - Storage utils to determine current usage, max size limit, and prompt user for persistence.

## Usage (high-level)

1. A new `LiveAtlas` is created, and "frames" are registered with the atlas accordingly
1. When a new frame is registered with the atlas, it is immediately created and made available for use - regardless of the state of the actual asset being loaded
  1. This allows devs to immediately reference a frame within the atlas without worrying about missing frame errors
1. A network request is made (via Phaser) for the texture asset.
1. Upon load, the frame's image data is quickly trimmed of its transparency
1. The new, trimmed frame is put into the "packer" and a spot for it is found in the LA texture
1. Finally, the frame is drawn into the LA texture, effectively making it available for use
  1. If the texture under the hood is not large enough, the size increases accordingly before drawing
1. By default, new assets are not guaranteed to be placed into the atlas in the most optimal configuration. When necessary, the atlas can be `repack`ed to save space and find a more optimal packing.
1. Finally, we can serialize the atlas via the `save` methods available (and later imported via `load`):
  1. `toLocalStorage`
  1. `toSessionStorage`
  1. `toIndexedDB`
  1. `toBrowserStorage` - Selects local storage or IDB depending on the atlas size.
  1. `toDiskFile` - Saves the image, frame, and packer data to an `.ATLAS` file
  1. `toImage` - Returns the spritesheet as an `HTMLImageElement`, useful for debugging.

TODO:
- Split texture into multiple sources (multiple RTs) so we can effectively have a multiatlas backed by render textures
- Identify WebGL vs Canvas issues and maybe report to the Phaser repo?
- Fill out README a bit more

BUGS:
- Multiple things calling `addFrame` at the same time produces weird results
  - race condition with loading/processing - we constantly create/destroy/etc even though once is enough

NON-GOALS:

- Off-thread texture save?
  - This can be handled by the application embedding the LA
